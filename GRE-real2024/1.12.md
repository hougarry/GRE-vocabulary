The sentence describes a volume that is surprising for its quality (or lack thereof) in certain respects, specifically mentioning issues with copy editing, proofreading, and the absence of desired maps or illustrations. Based on this context, let's fill in the blanks:

Blank (i): The contrast in the sentence suggests the volume appears to be of high quality or value, making the errors and lack of illustrations surprising. "Cheaply" would imply low quality, which wouldn't make the errors surprising. "Precipitately" implies haste, which could lead to errors but doesn't fit as well with the suggestion of quality. **"Handsomely"** suggests that the volume is well-made or attractive, making the presence of errors and lack of illustrations surprising.

Blank (ii): The sentence specifically mentions "disconcerting errors in copy editing and proofreading," which are best described as **"blemishes"**. "Fallacies" would imply logical or factual errors, which isn't specified here. "Tangents" would refer to deviations in content, not relevant to copy editing and proofreading errors.

Blank (iii): The sentence discusses the desirability of more illustrations but acknowledges a drawback in terms of cost. **"Prohibitively expensive"** fits best here, as it suggests that adding the desired number of illustrations would make the book too expensive. "Essentially indispensable" doesn't relate to the concern about cost, and "widely marketable" contradicts the implication that added costs could limit the book's market due to a higher price.

Therefore, the completed sentence reads: "It is surprising that such a **handsomely** produced volume should have occasional **blemishes** in the form of disconcerting errors in copy editing and proofreading. Somewhat more substantially, it would have been greatly enhanced had more maps or illustrations been provided, though against that it must be conceded that if the work were as liberally illustrated as could be desired, it would probably be **prohibitively expensive**."



In his new memoir, the novelist turns his unforgiving eye on himself and succeeds in giving us a self-portrait of the

artist as a young fool: petulant, pompous, obsessive, selfish, and overwhelmingly self-absorbed. While some admiring readers may say the novelist deserves (i). for being so revealing about himself, there is something oddly (ii)_ about his self-inventory of sins. He seems to actually have reveled in being so (iii).

Based on the description of the novelist's self-portrait in his memoir as petulant, pompous, obsessive, selfish, and overwhelmingly self-absorbed, let's fill in the blanks:

Blank (i): Given the context that the novelist is being praised for his revealing nature about his flaws, **points** fits as it implies credit or merit for his openness. "Opprobrium" refers to harsh criticism, which is not being given in this context for his self-revelation. "Obscurity" doesn't apply here since the context is about the recognition he might deserve for his candor.

Blank (ii): The description suggests there is an element of vanity or self-satisfaction in the way the novelist recounts his flaws. **Preening** captures this sense, as it implies a degree of self-admiration or vanity, fitting the context of an oddly self-satisfied recounting of one's own faults. "Reassuring" doesn't fit the context of vanity, and "diffident," meaning modest or shy, is the opposite of the description provided.

Blank (iii): Since the text describes the novelist's recounting of his flaws almost with a sense of pride, **disagreeable** fits best. It captures the nature of the sins he's listing (petulant, pompous, etc.) and aligns with the idea that he might find some perverse pleasure in being such a character. "Impotent" implies powerlessness, which doesn't fit the context of describing personal flaws in this way. "Dishonest" doesn't match the description since the focus is on the nature of the flaws he's proudly revealing, not on the truthfulness of his accounts.

Therefore, the completed sentence reads: "While some admiring readers may say the novelist deserves **points** for being so revealing about himself, there is something oddly **preening** about his self-inventory of sins. He seems to actually have reveled in being so **disagreeable**."
