The sentence describes a volume that is surprising for its quality (or lack thereof) in certain respects, specifically mentioning issues with copy editing, proofreading, and the absence of desired maps or illustrations. Based on this context, let's fill in the blanks:

Blank (i): The contrast in the sentence suggests the volume appears to be of high quality or value, making the errors and lack of illustrations surprising. "Cheaply" would imply low quality, which wouldn't make the errors surprising. "Precipitately" implies haste, which could lead to errors but doesn't fit as well with the suggestion of quality. **"Handsomely"** suggests that the volume is well-made or attractive, making the presence of errors and lack of illustrations surprising.

Blank (ii): The sentence specifically mentions "disconcerting errors in copy editing and proofreading," which are best described as **"blemishes"**. "Fallacies" would imply logical or factual errors, which isn't specified here. "Tangents" would refer to deviations in content, not relevant to copy editing and proofreading errors.

Blank (iii): The sentence discusses the desirability of more illustrations but acknowledges a drawback in terms of cost. **"Prohibitively expensive"** fits best here, as it suggests that adding the desired number of illustrations would make the book too expensive. "Essentially indispensable" doesn't relate to the concern about cost, and "widely marketable" contradicts the implication that added costs could limit the book's market due to a higher price.

Therefore, the completed sentence reads: "It is surprising that such a **handsomely** produced volume should have occasional **blemishes** in the form of disconcerting errors in copy editing and proofreading. Somewhat more substantially, it would have been greatly enhanced had more maps or illustrations been provided, though against that it must be conceded that if the work were as liberally illustrated as could be desired, it would probably be **prohibitively expensive**."
