Nature' s Metropolis was Cronon' s effort to show that the idea of a boundary between natural and unnatural is profoundly_____, that neither the city of Chicago nor its hinterland can be
understood independently of the other.
conspiratorial
reductive
derivative
abstruse
revisionist
Reductive means overly simplifying complex issues or ideas, which fits well in this context as it suggests that the idea of a clear boundary between natural and unnatural simplifies the complex interdependence between the city of Chicago and its hinterland.

Nothing in the book is (i). _ but happily there is no sense that the author is merely rummaging among minutiae, pursuing (ii). lines of inquiry neglected by other biographers.



Blank (i) contentious groundbreaking unfounded

Blank (ii)

tangential

rudimentary objectionable
For Blank (ii), given the context that the author isn't just "rummaging among minutiae," the pursuit would likely be described as exploring areas that are not central or main focus points of other biographers but are still worthy of exploration. "Tangential" lines of inquiry would be those that deviate from the central or most commonly explored themes, fitting the context of not focusing solely on minutiae but exploring areas neglected by others. "Rudimentary" implies basic or elementary, which doesn't quite fit the context of the sentence which implies a value in the pursuit. "Objectionable" means arousing disapproval, which is not suggested by the context. Therefore, tangential fits best, suggesting the author explores worthwhile, albeit less central, areas of inquiry.

Family lore has it that jazz saxophonist James Carter's perfect imitation of birdsong amazed his elementary-school classmates, marking him as ____conjurer of sound.

• an unruly
an unlikely
• an early
an astonishing
• a precocious

• a preposterous

To complete the sentence in a way that both fits the overall meaning and produces sentences alike in meaning, we should focus on words that describe James Carter as exceptionally skilled or noteworthy for his age or expectations, especially in relation to his ability to imitate birdsong which "amazed his elementary-school classmates."

an early suggests that Carter showed his remarkable skill at a young age, which aligns with the context provided by "elementary-school classmates."

a precocious implies that Carter exhibited abilities or talents beyond his years, particularly in the context of amazing his classmates with his imitation of birdsong. This word conveys a sense of advanced skill or talent at an unusually young age, fitting the narrative that marks him as exceptional.

Both "an early" and "a precocious" conjurer of sound effectively communicate that James Carter demonstrated exceptional musical talent or skill at a young age, consistent with the story of his elementary school achievements. 


Organic farming is often thought of as being (i). by its opposition to conventional industrialized agriculture. In truth, however, it is (ii) a unifying rationale for organic agriculture, and many contemporary understandings of organic agriculture are not even (jii).

Blank (i): Defined remains the best choice, as organic farming is often characterized or understood in relation to its opposition to conventional agriculture, which fits both interpretations.

Blank (ii): Considering impossible to divine, this choice suggests that it's difficult or impossible to clearly identify or understand a unifying rationale behind organic agriculture. This choice reflects a perspective that acknowledges the complexity or the nebulous nature of what drives or underpins organic farming practices, which might indeed better capture the sentence's intent by emphasizing the challenge in pinpointing a single, clear rationale.

Blank (iii): Complementary suggests that the contemporary understandings of organic agriculture, rather than being at odds or controversial, actually add to or enhance each other in some way, even if they aren't explicitly unified under a single rationale. This interpretation can provide an optimistic view of the diversity within organic farming practices and philosophies, suggesting that this diversity might not detract from the movement but rather enrich it.

Considering the nuances:

The defined, impossible to divine, complementary completion provides a nuanced perspective that acknowledges organic farming's complex relationship with conventional agriculture, highlights the difficulty in identifying a singular rationale behind organic practices, and suggests that the diversity within organic farming philosophies might enrich the field rather than weaken it.
