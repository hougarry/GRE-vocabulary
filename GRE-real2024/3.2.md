the feudal past--the outdated past

Fossils of the coral Acrocora palmata that date from the last period when glaciers grew and consequently spread from the polar regions are found at ocean depths far greater than those at which A. palmata can now survive. Therefore, although the fossilized A. palmata appears indistinguishable from A. palmata now living, it must have differed in important respects to have been able to live in deep water.



The argument depends on the assumption that
(A) no fossils of the coral A. palmata have been found that date from periods when glaciers were not spreading from the polar regions
(B) geological disturbances since the last period during which glaciers spread have caused no major downward shift in the location of A. palmata fossils
(C) A. palmata now live in shallow waters in most of the same geographical regions as those in which deep-lying A. palmata fossils have been found
(D) A. palmata fossils have been found that date from each of the periods during which glaciers are known to have spread from the polar region
(E) A. palmata can live at greater depths where the ocean temperature is colder than they can where the ocean temperature is warmer
