For each ride, a certain taxi company charges $2.80 for the Ô¨Årst mile traveled and $0.32 for each additional 1 /5 mile traveled or part thereof. What is the total amount that the taxi company charges for a 16.25-mile ride?
To calculate the total charge for a 16.25-mile ride by the taxi company, let's break down the charges as per the structure given:

1. **Charge for the first mile:** $2.80

2. **For the remaining 15.25 miles:** 
   - The charge is $0.32 for each additional 1/5 mile or part thereof. 
   - First, find out how many 1/5 mile segments are in 15.25 miles:
     - \(15.25 \text{ miles} \times \frac{5 \text{ segments}}{1 \text{ mile}} = 76.25 \text{ segments}\)
   - Since charges apply for "each additional 1/5 mile traveled or part thereof," and we have a fractional part of a segment (0.25 of a segment), we must round up to the nearest whole segment. This means we consider 77 segments for the remaining distance.
   - The charge for these segments is \(77 \times $0.32\).

3. **Calculate the total charge:**
   - \(77 \times $0.32 = $24.64\) for the additional segments.
   - Adding the first mile charge: $24.64 + $2.80 = $27.44.

Thus, the total amount that the taxi company charges for a 16.25-mile ride is **$27.44**.


Someone needs to import a number of sets ofbottles. Each bottle charges $12.04, and it alsocharges $4.8 for shipping each set (not singlebottle but a whole set). The standard deviation ofnumbers of bottles in each set is 1.5. What is thestandard deviation of the prices for each set?

12.04 * 1.5 = 18.06
