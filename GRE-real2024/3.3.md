Carla L. Peterson’s Doers of the Word (1997), a study of African American women speakers and writers from 1830-1880, is an important addition to scholarship on nineteenth-century African American women. Its scope resembles that of Frances Smith Fosters 1993 study, but its approach is quite different. For Foster, the Black women who came to literary voice in nineteenth-century America were claiming their rights as United States citizens, denying that anything should disqualify them from full membership in an enlightened national polity. Peterson sees these same women as having been fundamentally estranged from the nation by a dominant culture unsympathetic to Black women, and by a Black intelligentsia whose male view of race concerns left little room for Black female intellect.

It can be inferred that Peterson’s study and Fosters study are similar with respect to which of the following?
the writers that each takes up for examination
the degree to which each has influenced other scholars
the assumptions that each brings to nineteenth-century African American literature
their analysis of the nineteenth-century Black intelligentsia
their interpretation of nineteenth-century Americas dominant culture

Based on the passage's description of Carla L. Peterson’s and Frances Smith Foster's studies, we can deduce the similarities and differences between the two works. Peterson's "Doers of the Word" and Foster's study both focus on African American women speakers and writers from the 19th century, but they approach their subjects from different perspectives. Foster views these women as asserting their rights as citizens and seeking full membership in the national community, whereas Peterson portrays them as estranged from the nation due to the dominant culture's lack of sympathy and a male-centric Black intelligentsia.

Given this information, let’s analyze the options:

- **the writers that each takes up for examination:** The passage suggests that both studies cover African American women speakers and writers from 1830-1880. This similarity in scope implies that the writers they examine are likely to overlap, making this option a correct inference.

- **the degree to which each has influenced other scholars:** The passage does not provide information about the influence of either study on other scholars, so we cannot infer anything about their comparative impact on scholarship.

- **the assumptions that each brings to nineteenth-century African American literature:** The passage explicitly states that their approaches are quite different, with Foster focusing on the claim to citizenship and Peterson emphasizing estrangement from the nation. This indicates that their assumptions about nineteenth-century African American literature are different, not similar.

- **their analysis of the nineteenth-century Black intelligentsia:** The passage only mentions Peterson's view of the Black intelligentsia as having a male view that left little room for Black female intellect. Foster's perspective on the Black intelligentsia is not discussed, so we cannot infer a similarity in their analysis of this group.

- **their interpretation of nineteenth-century America's dominant culture:** The passage indicates that Peterson sees the dominant culture as unsympathetic to Black women, but it does not provide specific details about Foster's interpretation of the dominant culture, only that Foster views the women as claiming their rights as citizens. Therefore, we cannot confidently infer that their interpretations of the dominant culture are similar.

Based on the passage, the correct answer is:
- **the writers that each takes up for examination:** This option is supported by the passage’s mention of the similar scope of both studies, implying that they examine a similar set of writers from the same period.
