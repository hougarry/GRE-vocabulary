For the sentence to logically and coherently express the ideas intended:

Blank (i): The sentence sets up the context that it's too soon to definitively assess the writer's talent, pointing towards a process of evaluation that is complicated by a lack of perspective among other difficulties. The best fit for this context is **judgment**. "Claim" and "affirmation" don't fit as well because the sentence is about the difficulty of making an evaluative determination, not making a claim or giving affirmation.

Blank (ii): The phrase "casting a spell over receptive readers" suggests that the writer's books have a strong impact on readers, to the point of affecting their ability to critically assess the work. **Dull** fits best here, as it suggests the books have the effect of blunting or reducing the critical faculties of the readers, which aligns with the notion of "casting a spell" that inhibits normal critical engagement.

Blank (iii): Given that the books are described as having an effect that diminishes the readers' critical faculties, the readers' response would logically be to **ignore** reason. This means that they overlook or disregard rational or critical analysis when engaging with her works. "Exemplify" does not fit the context of a negative impact on critical faculties, and "overestimate" doesn't directly relate to the idea of neglecting critical analysis.

Thus, the sentence completed would read: "How good a writer was she? It is too soon to be certain, and lack of distance is only one of the difficulties in making that **judgment**. Her books seem not merely to entertain, but, by casting a spell over receptive readers, to **dull** their critical faculties: many who read them tend to **ignore** reason."
