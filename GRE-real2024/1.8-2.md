-
The sentence describes the tradition in English Studies of different paradigms of literary interpretation operating simultaneously, even though they offer differing explanations of the same literary works. The context suggests a diversity of approaches and opinions within the field, reflecting either a potential issue or a strength, depending on one's perspective.

Blank (i): Given the context that different paradigms produce varying explanations for the same work, **incompatible** fits best. "Arcane" implies complexity or obscurity, which doesn't directly relate to the issue of different paradigms giving differing explanations. "Repetitious" suggests redundancy, which contradicts the notion of differing explanations.

Blank (ii): The mention of "different paradigms of literary interpretation" operating "side by side" aligns with the concept of **pluralism**. This term accurately describes a situation where multiple distinct perspectives or approaches coexist. "Populism" and "rigidity" do not fit the context; "populism" refers to appeal to the general population, and "rigidity" implies inflexibility, which contradicts the described diversity of approaches.

Blank (iii): Since the passage frames the coexistence of multiple paradigms as either a sign of disciplinary problem or as evidence of intellectual vitality, **weakness** is the word that best fits the gap. It contrasts directly with "intellectual vibrancy," suggesting that some see the variety of interpretations as a potential flaw or issue ("disciplinary weakness"), while others view it as a strength.

Thus, the completed sentence reads: "It has long been a tradition in English Studies for different paradigms of literary interpretation, with their different ways of understanding literary texts, to pursue their activities side by side, even though they produce **incompatible** explanations of the same work. Although for some, this theoretical **pluralism** has been an indication of disciplinary **weakness**, for others it stands as testimony to the intellectual vibrancy of the discipline."
