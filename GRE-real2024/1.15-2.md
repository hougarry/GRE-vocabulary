Selling a product with no known or even _____ substitute and with an ever-growing demand for it seems as if it would be quite lucrative, but in fact the three biggest private-sector water companies in the world are eager to get out of the business.

recognized
practicable 
proÔ¨Åtable 
acknowledged
 imaginable 
conceivable

The sentence describes a situation where a product, which has no substitute and an increasing demand, would typically be expected to yield high profits. Yet, it mentions a counterintuitive scenario where major water companies want to exit the business. The blanks need words that emphasize the uniqueness or lack of alternatives to the product in question.

The two words that fit this context and produce sentences with similar meanings are:

acknowledged: This term suggests that there is no substitute for the product that is recognized or accepted widely. Using "acknowledged" emphasizes the absence of any universally recognized alternative.

conceivable: This word means capable of being imagined or thought of. In the context of the sentence, saying there is no "conceivable" substitute highlights that not only is there no existing substitute, but it's also hard to even imagine one existing.

Both "acknowledged" and "conceivable" convey the idea that the product (in this case, water) is in a unique position with no real or imaginable substitutes, fitting the sentence's overall meaning.


The reader does well to approach claims in this autobiography with a certain amount of friendly skepticism, but the overall impression it conveys is that veracity wins out over___

blame

invention

contrivance 
censure
 venom
 concern

 In this sentence, the contrast is between the suggested skepticism towards the autobiography's claims and the eventual triumph of truthfulness or honesty in the narrative. Therefore, the blanks need words that imply something opposite or at least divergent from "veracity" (truthfulness), suggesting elements of the autobiography that could be doubted or seen as less than completely truthful.

The two words that fit this context and produce sentences with alike meaning are:

- **invention**: This implies something that is created or fabricated, which can contrast with the truth or factual accuracy, fitting the sentence's intent by suggesting that truth wins out over fabricated elements.

- **contrivance**: Similar to invention, contrivance implies something artificially created rather than naturally occurring or truthful. It suggests that despite any artificial constructs or fabricated stories, the overall impression is one of honesty prevailing.

Both "invention" and "contrivance" suggest elements that could be fabricated or not wholly truthful, making them suitable contrasts to veracity in the context of evaluating the autobiography's claims. Therefore, the completed sentence would emphasize that, despite potential fabrications or artificial constructs, honesty is the dominant impression left by the autobiography.
