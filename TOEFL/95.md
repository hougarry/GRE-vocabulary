From about 4.6 to 4.5 billion years ago,the Sun and planets in the solar system formed from the solar nebula-a rotating disk of gas and dust.As temperatures gradually dropped,some gases in the nebula turned into liquids or solids in a process called condensation.Different materials condense at different temperatures.It was cold enough for hydrogen compounds in the nebula to condense into solid ices only beyond the frost line,which lay between the present-day orbits of Mars and Jupiter.The frost line marked the key transition between the warm inner regions of the solar system where terrestrial planets (Mercury,Venus,Earth. and Mars) formed and the cool outer regions where Jovian planets (Jupiter,Saturn,Uranus,and Neptune)formed.Inside the frost line, only metal and rock could condense into solid "seeds."Beyond the frost line,the solid seeds were built of ice along with metal and rock.

According to paragraph 1.which of the following was true of the solar nebula after it began to cool?
A.More condensation occurred in the area of the present-day terrestrial planets.
B.Hydrogen compounds remained gases inside the frost line.
C.The seeds of planets beyond the frost line formed when metal and rock joined with ices that had already condensed.
D.Most of the materials that condensed were located near the frost line.

Analyzing the paragraph on the formation of the solar system and the process of condensation within the solar nebula provides insights into how different materials and planets formed based on their position relative to the frost line. Let's break down the paragraph and then analyze each answer option.

### Paragraph Analysis
- **Formation Timeframe**: The Sun and planets formed from the solar nebula about 4.6 to 4.5 billion years ago.
- **Solar Nebula**: A rotating disk of gas and dust that cooled over time, leading to the process of condensation.
- **Condensation**: The transformation of gases in the nebula into liquids or solids at different temperatures.
- **Frost Line**: Marks a critical boundary between warmer inner and cooler outer regions of the solar system.
  - Inside the frost line: Only metal and rock could condense into solid seeds.
  - Beyond the frost line: Ices, along with metal and rock, could condense, forming solid seeds.

### Option Analysis
A. **More condensation occurred in the area of the present-day terrestrial planets.**
- The paragraph does not quantify where "more" condensation occurred. It distinguishes between the types of materials that could condense inside vs. outside the frost line.

B. **Hydrogen compounds remained gases inside the frost line.**
- This option is consistent with the paragraph's description. It states that beyond the frost line, hydrogen compounds could condense into solid ices, implying that inside the frost line, where it was warmer, these compounds remained gases.

C. **The seeds of planets beyond the frost line formed when metal and rock joined with ices that had already condensed.**
- This option is supported by the paragraph. It mentions that beyond the frost line, the solid seeds were built of ice along with metal and rock, indicating that the ices combined with metal and rock to form the seeds of the Jovian planets.

D. **Most of the materials that condensed were located near the frost line.**
- The paragraph does not specify where most materials condensed. It differentiates the types of materials that could condense based on their location relative to the frost line but does not indicate a concentration of condensed materials near the frost line.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- Option **B** is a logical inference but not directly stated. The paragraph implies this condition by stating that only beyond the frost line could hydrogen compounds condense into solid ices, suggesting they remained gases inside the frost line.
- Option **C** directly correlates with the information provided in the paragraph. It accurately describes the process by which planet seeds formed beyond the frost line through the condensation of ices, metal, and rock.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer, directly supported by the paragraph's description of planetary formation processes related to the frost line.
