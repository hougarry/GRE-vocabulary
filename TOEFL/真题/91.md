Originally,the oceans were favored as the key to the perplexing Eocene climate.Often regarded as the heat engine of Earth,the oceans have an enormous capacity for storing and redistributing tropical warmth in surface currents that migrate poleward,driven by prevailing wind patterns and changes in salinity that happen en route as water evaporates.The Gulf Stream,which flows from Florida across the Atlantic and into northern Europe,is a well-known example of this heat transport.It ensures that Europe is several degrees warmer than it would otherwise be.One idea,then, for explaining the Eocene warmth was to somehow increase the transport of heat from the equator up to the high latitudes.But there turned out to be some problems with this explanation,because later calculations showed that to get the polar regions warm enough required increasing the poleward transport of heat by 30 percent, an incredibly large amount.And in spite of diverting the attention of the world's climate scientists for several decades, no one has yet found a satisfactory means of achieving such a massive shift in either the sprightly circulation of surface ocean or the more stately paced circulation of the deep oceans. --

(A)The study of the Gulf Stream has diverted the attention of most climate scientists,and progress on the understanding of equally Important ocean circulation patterns has been slow
According to the paragraph, Does (A) right or wrong?

The statement (A) is not directly supported by the information provided in the paragraph. The paragraph discusses the role of the oceans, particularly the heat transport mechanisms like the Gulf Stream, in the context of explaining the warm climate during the Eocene epoch. It mentions the hypothesis that increasing the transport of heat from the equator to high latitudes could explain the Eocene warmth but highlights the difficulty in achieving a sufficient increase in heat transport to explain the observed temperatures.
The text does not imply that the study of the Gulf Stream itself has caused other areas of ocean circulation research to progress slowly. Instead, it suggests that despite significant attention from the climate science community, a satisfactory explanation for the massive shift in heat transport required to account for Eocene warmth has not been found. The reference to the diversion of attention is more about the extensive effort spent on trying to understand and solve this particular puzzle, rather than suggesting that the Gulf Stream research has slowed progress in understanding other ocean circulation patterns.
