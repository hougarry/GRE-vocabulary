For the first question, according to paragraph 2 of the passage, the TWO forces that cause glaciers to move are:

B. Gravity: The passage states, "Gravity moves the glacier with the rocks and boulders that the glacier picks up."
D. The cutting action of its rock components: This is implied through the explanation of how glaciers, carrying rocks and boulders, reshape the land, acting as cutting tools.
For the second question, to complete the summary with the 3 answer choices that express the most important ideas in the passage:

B. The weight of very thick glacial ice can gradually depress the surface of the land, and it takes many thousands of years after the ice melts for the land to return to its original level.
C. In steep mountainous regions, moving glaciers reshape valleys and create basins, and where several glaciers grow together, they often leave behind sharp, high peaks, serrate ridges, and hanging valleys.
A. Throughout the last glacial cycle, which lasted roughly 12,000 years, glacial ice steadily built up over the continental areas until in some places it reached a depth of over a thousand feet.
Choices B and C directly reflect significant impacts of glaciers described in the passage: the depression of the land's surface due to the weight of the ice and the reshaping of mountainous terrain, respectively. Choice A provides a context for the duration and scale of glaciation, aligning with the general theme of the passage regarding the transformative power of glaciers on the Earth's surface. Choices D, E, and F introduce points not directly supported by the passage's details or emphasize minor or incorrectly interpreted aspects relative to the main ideas presented.
