Accurate terminology that did not privilege one function over another would require the coinage of a portmanteau term such as "palace-temple” or "temple-palace,” but this seems an undesirable deviation from terminology that is long established, whatever its shortcomings.

Structure: Accurate terminology B would require C, but this D, whatever E.

Organization:
1. Main sentence: ➤Accurate terminology➤ @would require@ »the coinage of a portmanteau term such as "palace-temple” or "temple-palace"«
2. Conjunction: &but&
3. Predicate with a subject: ➤this➤ @seems@ {an undesirable deviation} from »terminology that is long established«
4. Parenthetical explanation of the deviation: ⧏whatever its shortcomings⧐

We see flowers, the ocean are inevitable lucky quiz with human subjects largely absent which is art considering how it might have been surrounded by people

Structure: We see A, B are C, which is D.

Organization:
1. Main sentence: ➤We see➤ »flowers, the ocean«
2. Conjunction: &are&
3. Second part of the main sentence: ➤the ocean➤ @are@ {inevitable lucky quiz} with »human subjects largely absent«
4. Relative clause modifying the second part: which @is@ {art considering how it might have been surrounded by people}

The structure attempts to link disparate elements (flowers, the ocean, and a "lucky quiz" with human subjects absent) in a way that is not immediately clear, reflecting challenges in clarity and coherence that could be problematic in GRE writing tasks. The use of "which is art considering how it might have been surrounded by people" attempts to introduce a reflective or speculative aspect to the statement, a stylistic element that could be explored in GRE analytical writing to discuss the implications or deeper meanings behind a subject. However, the coherence and precision of expression are crucial for effectively conveying complex ideas on the GRE.
