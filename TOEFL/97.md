**One important consequence of all this was that there was a progressive and massive increase in root biomass during the Devonian, which had an enormous impact on the development of soils. Prior to the Devonian,soils, if developed at all, are thought to have been predominantly thin and of microbial origin. By the Middle Devonian,soil penetration depths of roots were still shallow(less than 20 centimeters) but this increased to 1 meter or more as forests spread.The diversity of soils also increased.This change was brought about by root-induced weathering and mixing. By the end of the Devonian, there was an increase in soil clay content,structure,and differentiation into distinct layers-a development that correlated with increases in depth of root penetration. Soils with modern profiles(series of layers) are recognizable at this time.
Accoding to ​paragraph 4, which of the following is true aboutsoils before the Devonian? C
A.They gradually developed a large root biomass.
B.They benefited from root-induced weathering and mixing.
C.They were rather undeveloped and thin.
D.They were not easily penetrated by roots.**



The statement "Prior to the Devonian, soils, if developed at all, [if the soil could be developed,means the soil is underdeveloped]are thought to have been predominantly thin and of microbial origin"
[even if the soil could be developed, it would be thin, so the soil is ]
suggests that before the Devonian period, any soil that did exist was primarily thin and mostly made up of microbial materials. The phrase "if developed at all" implies that in many cases, what could be considered soil was minimal or nearly nonexistent in terms of development when compared to later periods. This doesn't mean that soils were completely absent; rather, where they existed, they were fundamentally different (i.e., thinner and less complex) than what we understand as soil today, especially post-Devonian.

**Accoding to ​paragraph 4, which of the following was a result of increased depth in root penetration by the end of the Devonian?A
A.Soils were formed with series of layers in the same way that soils that exist today are formed.
B.There was significantly less clay in soils than there had been during the Middle Devonian.
C.The deepest roots extended almost up to 1 meter below the surface of the ground.
D.Root-induced weathering and mixing made soil more even in composition at all depths than it had been before.**

D suggests that the action of plant roots has led to a more uniform distribution of soil components throughout all layers of the soil.[even  adj /not adv]

To clarify why option C is correct and E is wrong, let's delve into the details provided in the text about the behavior and characteristics of comets within our solar system:

### Why C is Correct:

Option C states: "comets have different orbital periods from one another, and the amount of ice they retain varies depending on how often they pass close to the Sun during their orbits."

This is correct because:

1. **Different Orbital Periods:** The text mentions that there are long-period comets, which may take millions of years to complete an orbit (such as those from the Oort Cloud), and short-period comets, like Halley's Comet, which has a period of 76 years and is believed to originate from the Kuiper Belt. This clearly indicates that comets do indeed have different orbital periods from one another.

2. **Variation in Ice Retention:** The passage explains how comets lose their ice when they pass close to the Sun, turning them eventually into small rocks if they do so many times. This inherently suggests that the amount of ice a comet retains is directly influenced by how often and how closely it approaches the Sun during its orbit, supporting the second part of statement C.

### Why E is Wrong:

Option E states: "Some comets orbit near giant planets while others orbit near dwarf planets, and those that orbit near dwarf planets reappear at greater intervals than those that orbit near giant planets."

This statement is incorrect because:

1. **Orbits Near Giant vs. Dwarf Planets:** The text does not provide any information to suggest that the distinction between comets' orbital intervals (how often they appear) is based on whether they orbit near giant planets or dwarf planets. Instead, the difference in the frequency of appearances (orbital periods) of comets is attributed to their originating region in the solar system (Oort Cloud for long-period comets and Kuiper Belt for short-period comets), not their proximity to giant or dwarf planets.

2. **Misrepresentation of Orbital Dynamics:** The assertion that comets orbiting near dwarf planets reappear at greater intervals than those orbiting near giant planets oversimplifies and misrepresents the complex dynamics of cometary orbits. The text explains that the source of long-period comets is the Oort Cloud and that of short-period comets is likely the Kuiper Belt. While gravitational interactions with planets (giant or dwarf) can affect cometary orbits, the text does not support the claim made in E regarding the correlation between orbital intervals and proximity to different types of planets.

In summary, C is correct because it accurately reflects the variability in cometary orbits and ice retention based on their solar approaches, as described in the text. E is incorrect because it makes unfounded claims about the relationship between cometary appearances and their proximity to different types of planets, which is not supported by the information provided.
