One important consequence of all this was that there was a progressive and massive increase in root biomass during the Devonian, which had an enormous impact on the development of soils. Prior to the Devonian,soils, if developed at all, are thought to have been predominantly thin and of microbial origin. By the Middle Devonian,soil penetration depths of roots were still shallow(less than 20 centimeters) but this increased to 1 meter or more as forests spread.The diversity of soils also increased.This change was brought about by root-induced weathering and mixing. By the end of the Devonian, there was an increase in soil clay content,structure,and differentiation into distinct layers-a development that correlated with increases in depth of root penetration. Soils with modern profiles(series of layers) are recognizable at this time.
Accoding to ​paragraph 4, which of the following is true aboutsoils before the Devonian?
A.They gradually developed a large root biomass.
B.They benefited from root-induced weathering and mixing.
C.They were rather undeveloped and thin.
D.They were not easily penetrated by roots.

The statement "Prior to the Devonian, soils, if developed at all, [if exist,]are thought to have been predominantly thin and of microbial origin" suggests that before the Devonian period, any soil that did exist was primarily thin and mostly made up of microbial materials. The phrase "if developed at all" implies that in many cases, what could be considered soil was minimal or nearly nonexistent in terms of development when compared to later periods. This doesn't mean that soils were completely absent; rather, where they existed, they were fundamentally different (i.e., thinner and less complex) than what we understand as soil today, especially post-Devonian.

The confusion might stem from interpreting "rather thin" as implying there was a significant amount of soil development but it was just a bit thin. Instead, the text indicates that soils were in a very basic, undeveloped state. So, "rather undeveloped and thin" should be understood as describing the general condition of soils at the time — they were significantly underdeveloped (to the point of being minimal) and, where present, were thin.

To address your point directly: The reality of soils being undeveloped before the Devonian does not contradict them being described as "thin." It's not that soils were "a little thin" but rather that they were fundamentally lacking in complexity and depth, making "thin" an appropriate descriptor for their condition. The emphasis is on the lack of development and the minimal, simple nature of the soils that existed, rather than on a gradation of thickness.

So, to clarify, the paragraph is explaining that before the Devonian, soils were essentially minimal, very basic, and thin, reflecting a very early stage of soil development primarily influenced by microbial activity rather than the complex, root-structured soils that would come later.
