During the 1920s, most proponents of scientiﬁc management, Frederick Taylor’s approach for 
maximizing workers’ productivity by intensively routinizing their jobs, antagonized the ﬁve-day 
workweek. Despite scientiﬁc managers conceded that decreasing hours might supply an incentive 
to workers, in practice they more often utilized pay differentials to encourage higher productivity. 
Those reformers who wanted to accept both scientiﬁc management and reduced hours had to 
make a greatly negative case, depicting the latter as an antidote to the rigors of the former. In 
conﬂict to the scientiﬁc managers, Henry Ford stated that shorter hours caused larger productivity 
and proﬁts. However, few employers matched either Ford’s vision or his particular interest in mass 
marketing a product—automobiles—that requested leisure for its use, and few unions succeeded 
in saving shorter hours through bargaining. At its 1928 convention, the American Federation of 
Labor (AFL) boasted of approachingly 165,000 members working ﬁve-day, 40-hour weeks. 
But even though this represented an raise of about 75,000 since 1926, about 70 percent of the 
entire came from ﬁve enormously well-organized building trades’ unions.

# answers analysis
1. The passage is primarily concerned with discussing which of the following?

A. The relative merits of two points of view regarding a controversy - This seems plausible as the passage discusses different views on work hours and productivity, particularly between scientific managers and proponents like Henry Ford.
B. The potential benefits to workers in the 1920s of a change in employers’ policies - The passage does touch on this, but it's not the primary focus.
C. The reasons for a labor-management disagreement during the 1920s - The passage does mention different perspectives but doesn't delve deeply into the reasons behind these disagreements.
D. The status of a contested labor issue during the 1920s - This is a strong contender as the passage discusses the issue of work hours and productivity, highlighting differing views and their outcomes.
E. The role of labor unions in bringing about a reform - While the passage mentions unions, their role is not the central focus.
Correct Answer: D. The status of a contested labor issue during the 1920s. The passage mainly discusses the differing views on workweek length and productivity during the 1920s, making this the primary focus.

2. It can be inferred that the author of the passage mentions “automobiles” primarily to suggest that

A. Ford’s business produced greater profits than did businesses requiring a workweek longer than five days - Not directly suggested in the passage.
B. Ford, unlike most other employers, encouraged his employees to use the products they produced - This is not the main point of mentioning automobiles.
C. Ford may have advocated shorter hours because of the particular nature of his business - This is likely, as the passage connects Ford's advocacy for shorter hours to his interest in mass marketing automobiles, which require leisure time to use.
D. Unions were more likely to negotiate for shorter hours in some businesses than in others - The passage doesn't specifically make this claim.
E. Automobile workers’ unions were more effective than other unions in securing a five-day workweek - This is not implied in the passage.
Correct Answer: C. Ford may have advocated shorter hours because of the particular nature of his business. The passage implies that Ford's support for shorter hours was linked to his business in automobiles, which benefits from leisure time.


Let's reanalyze Questions 3 and 4 with a focus on the passage structure:

**Passage Structure Analysis:**
- **S1 - Introduction to Scientific Management:** Introduces Frederick Taylor's approach and notes its antagonism towards the five-day workweek.
- **S2 - Scientific Managers' Practices:** Discusses how scientific managers preferred pay differentials over reduced hours as incentives for productivity.
- **S3 - Reformers' Challenge:** Describes the difficulty reformers faced in advocating for reduced hours alongside scientific management.
- **S4 - Contrasting Viewpoint (Henry Ford):** Presents Henry Ford's belief that shorter hours increase productivity and profits, different from most employers and scientific managers.
- **S5 - Limited Adoption of Shorter Hours:** Notes the limited success in adopting shorter hours, both in the industry and through union bargaining.
- **S6 - AFL Statistics and Implication:** Provides specific statistics from the AFL, with a focus on the distribution of the five-day, 40-hour weeks among its members.

**Question 3: It can be inferred that the author of the passage would probably agree with which of the following claims about the boast highlighted?**

- **D. It overestimates the bargaining prowess of the AFL building trades’ unions during the 1920s.** Considering the structure and content of the passage, particularly S6, this choice is more aligned. The passage indicates that a large part of the AFL’s success in achieving shorter workweeks was concentrated in a few well-organized building trades' unions. This could suggest that the overall bargaining prowess of the AFL's unions might be overestimated, based on these specific successes.

**Question 4: According to the passage, the “reformers” claimed that**

- **B. The impact that the routinization of work had on workers could be mitigated by a reduction in the length of their workweek.** This choice is directly supported by S3, where the passage discusses the reformers' viewpoint. They had to make a "greatly negative case," suggesting that they saw reduced hours as a necessary balance or antidote to the intensive routinization of jobs under scientific management. This implies they believed that reducing work hours could alleviate the negative impacts of such routinization.
A. Neither scientific management nor reduced hours would result in an improvement in the working conditions of most workers - The passage doesn't make this claim.
B. The impact that the routinization of work had on workers could be mitigated by a reduction in the length of their workweek - This aligns with the passage, which describes the reformers as depicting reduced hours as an antidote to the rigors of scientific management.
C. There was an inherent tension between the principles of scientific management and a commitment to reduced workweeks - While this might be inferred, it's not explicitly claimed by the reformers in the passage.
D. Scientific managers were more likely than other managers to use pay differentials to encourage higher productivity - The passage mentions this, but it's not attributed as a



## Question

--
My understanding: 
S1-S3,  reformers: scientific managements-shorter hours- higher productivity
Ford also believe this despite of his business, why use " in conflict to " ,  
I don't understand s6, AFL part, why the author write this part, what's it's relationship with Ford and reformers?

## Answer
Your understanding of the first part of the passage is on track. Let's clarify the connections and the role of the AFL information in the context of the passage:

- **S1-S3 (Reformers and Scientific Management):** These sections discuss the general view of scientific management in the 1920s, focusing on its approach to maximizing worker productivity through intensive job routinization. The reformers, while acknowledging the potential productivity gains of scientific management, also see the need for shorter work hours to balance its rigors.

- **Ford's Stance (In Conflict to Scientific Managers):** The phrase "in conflict to the scientific managers" signifies that Henry Ford's viewpoint stands in opposition to the general stance of scientific managers. While the scientific managers were more inclined to use pay differentials to boost productivity, Ford argued that shorter hours could lead to higher productivity and profits. This conflict highlights a differing perspective on how best to achieve productivity in the workplace. Ford's position aligns with the reformers' view but is notable because it comes from a successful industrialist, which adds a different dimension to the debate.

- **S6 (AFL and Its Role):** The American Federation of Labor (AFL) information serves several purposes:
  - **Real-world Impact:** It provides real-world evidence of the implementation and impact of the ideas discussed earlier in the passage. While the reformers and Ford advocated for shorter workweeks, the AFL statistics show the actual progress made in this area.
  - **Contrast with Earlier Discussions:** The passage shows that despite the advocacy for shorter workweeks, the widespread adoption of this practice was limited. The AFL’s boast about its members working five-day, 40-hour weeks indicates progress, but the fact that a significant portion of this achievement came from just five building trades' unions suggests that the success was not as widespread as it might appear.
  - **Contextualizing the Debate:** By discussing the AFL’s achievements, the author provides a broader context to understand the impact of the debates and viewpoints of reformers and figures like Ford. It shows how these ideas were playing out in the real world, specifically in the labor movement and union negotiations.

In summary, the AFL part is included to give a more comprehensive picture of the era's labor situation, showing how the ideas and debates around work hours and productivity were materializing in the real world, particularly in the labor movement. It helps to ground the earlier theoretical discussions in actual outcomes and developments.
