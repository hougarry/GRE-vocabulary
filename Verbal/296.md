Federal courts in the United States, especially before the famous 1962 case of Baker v. Carr, were 
often thought to be powerless in the area of election law, voting rights, and other legal questions 
clearly bearing on politics. This perception was not entirely correct, of course, as pre-1962 
Supreme Court decisions such as that in the case of Smith v. Allwright demonstrated in the wake of 
that decision, voting participation among African Americans in the South increased substantially. 
However, political rights had not always been so clearly championed by the Supreme Court as they 
were in Smith v. Allwright. Indeed, the transformations between the Civil War and 1962 were such 
that, in reviewing voters’ rights cases over the intervening decades, one feels like an archaeologist 
cutting through distinct layers in which the judicial decisions uncovered reveal a pattern of 
ideological and societal change. 
1. The author of the passage uses the analogy of the archaeology most probably in order to                
A. contrast judicial decisions made after 1962 concerning voters rights with decision made 
immediately after the Civil War                         
B. suggest that the author is perplexed by many judicial decisions regarding voters’ rights                        
C. characterize the nature of change in judicial thinking regarding voters’ rights                                    
D. indicate that much of the history of voters’ rights has been lost since the Civil War                               
E. illustrate the lack of concern for voters’ rights exhibited by federal courts before the Civil 
War  
2. Which of the following can be inferred regarding the case of Baker v. Carr?
A. Its outcome required clariﬁcation in subsequent decisions rendered by the Supreme Court.              
B. Its resolution attested to the power of federal courts to address legal issues related to politics.       
C. It marked a radical change in judicial thinking in the United States.                                                
D. It was decided before the Supreme Courts heard the case of Smith v. Allwright.                                   
E. It has little historical signiﬁcance aside from its focus on laws affecting politics. 


## analysis


## answer
Let's analyze each question based on the passage:

**1. The author of the passage uses the analogy of the archaeology most probably in order to**

- **A. Contrast judicial decisions made after 1962 concerning voters' rights with decisions made immediately after the Civil War.** - The analogy does not specifically contrast post-1962 decisions with those immediately after the Civil War.
- **B. Suggest that the author is perplexed by many judicial decisions regarding voters’ rights.** - The analogy of archaeology does not imply perplexity; it's more about revealing layers of history.
- **C. Characterize the nature of change in judicial thinking regarding voters’ rights.** - This seems the most likely purpose. The analogy suggests a gradual, layered change over time in judicial decisions, akin to the way layers of soil reveal different historical periods in archaeology.
- **D. Indicate that much of the history of voters’ rights has been lost since the Civil War.** - The passage doesn't suggest that history has been lost, but rather that it can be uncovered and understood like layers in an archaeological site.
- **E. Illustrate the lack of concern for voters’ rights exhibited by federal courts before the Civil War.** - The analogy is used more to show change over time, not specifically a lack of concern.

**Correct Answer:** C. Characterize the nature of change in judicial thinking regarding voters’ rights. The analogy of archaeology is used to illustrate the historical progression and evolution in judicial decisions about voters' rights.

**2. Which of the following can be inferred regarding the case of Baker v. Carr?**

- **A. Its outcome required clarification in subsequent decisions rendered by the Supreme Court.** - The passage doesn't provide information about subsequent clarifications to the decision.
- **B. Its resolution attested to the power of federal courts to address legal issues related to politics.** - This seems plausible because the passage starts by noting the perceived powerlessness of federal courts in these areas before Baker v. Carr, implying that this case demonstrated their power.
- **C. It marked a radical change in judicial thinking in the United States.** - While the passage implies change, it doesn’t specifically state that Baker v. Carr marked a 'radical' change.
- **D. It was decided before the Supreme Court heard the case of Smith v. Allwright.** - This is incorrect; Smith v. Allwright was decided before 1962, and Baker v. Carr was in 1962.
- **E. It has little historical significance aside from its focus on laws affecting politics.** - The passage suggests Baker v. Carr was significant, especially in changing perceptions of the federal courts' role.

**Correct Answer:** B. Its resolution attested to the power of federal courts to address legal issues related to politics. The case is presented as a turning point in the perception of federal courts' role in election law, voting rights, and political legal questions.
