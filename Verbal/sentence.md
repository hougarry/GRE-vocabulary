Sentence Analysis:
"Nicolaus Copernicus was much less _____ than commonly thought: he wanted to improve the cosmological theory of his day by introducing one important change while preserving as many of its conceptual foundations as possible."

The structure of the sentence suggests a contrast between the general perception of Copernicus and the reality of his intentions. The key part is "he wanted to improve the cosmological theory of his day by introducing one important change while preserving as many of its conceptual foundations as possible." This indicates that, while he did introduce a significant change, his approach was not about completely overthrowing or disregarding the existing theories.

Answer Choices Analysis:

A. Visionary – implies someone with original ideas about what the future will or could be like.
B. Philosophical – pertains to the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence.
C. Revolutionary – involves a dramatic and wide-reaching change.
D. Iconoclastic – describes someone who attacks or criticizes cherished beliefs or institutions.
E. Diplomatic – relates to managing international relations, typically involving sensitivity and tact.
F. Circumspect – means wary and unwilling to take risks.
Choosing the Right Word:
Given the context, we're looking for a word that suggests Copernicus was thought to be someone who drastically changed or challenged existing beliefs, but in reality, he was more about making a significant yet not total overhaul of the system.

Choices C (Revolutionary) and D (Iconoclastic) fit this context. 'Revolutionary' implies a complete or fundamental change, and 'iconoclastic' suggests attacking established beliefs. Both are in line with the idea of being "much less _____ than commonly thought," as Copernicus was not completely overthrowing the existing system but rather modifying it while keeping its foundations.
Thus, the correct answers are C (Revolutionary) and D (Iconoclastic), as these choices best fit the context of Copernicus making important changes, yet not as radical as completely discarding the established cosmological theories.
